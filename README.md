"My name is Ubaid and I am a computer science graduate. My degree was 
primarily based around software engineering giving me a strong base 
in the processes of software development but also covered a range of 
other topics including artificial intelligence, machine learning, 
cybersecurity etc. giving me the opportunity to develop a more COMPLETE 
arsenal skills. As part of my studies i also participated in a number 
of group and individual projects, allowing me to develop a range of 
skills related to communicating and coordinating effectively with others 
in a working environment which will be TREMENDOUSLY useful throughout 
the course of my career

I'm interested in DevOps because of the potential it holds in virtue of 
bridging the gap between development and operations. It's an expanding 
market presenting EXCITING opportunities. and Sparta Global is an apt 
place for me to learn, given that it's oriented towards teaching young 
graduates and preparing them for the workplace"
